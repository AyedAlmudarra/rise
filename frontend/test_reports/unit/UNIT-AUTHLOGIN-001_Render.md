# Unit Test Case Report: AuthLogin Initial Render

## Test Case Title
[UNIT-AUTHLOGIN-001] should render login form elements correctly

## Test Case ID
UNIT-AUTHLOGIN-001

## Requirement ID
(Implicit requirement for Login functionality - Form Rendering)

## Author
Ayed

## Description
Verifies that the `AuthLogin` component renders its core UI elements (email input, password input, submit button) when initially mounted. Checks for external links (like "Forgot Password" or "Create Account") were removed as they belong to the parent view, not this specific form component.

## Test Steps
1.  Render the `AuthLogin` component within a `BrowserRouter`.
2.  Use `@testing-library/react`'s `screen` queries to locate elements:
    *   Email input via its associated label ("Email Address").
    *   Password input via its associated label ("Password").
    *   Submit button via its accessible role and name ("Sign In").
3.  Assert that each located element is present in the document using `expect(...).toBeInTheDocument()`. 

## Test Script
```typescript
// Test case from frontend/src/views/authentication/authforms/AuthLogin.test.tsx

test('[UNIT-AUTHLOGIN-001] should render login form elements correctly', () => { 
  renderComponent(); // Helper that renders AuthLogin in BrowserRouter

  // Check for email input (using label)
  expect(screen.getByLabelText(/Email Address/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  
  // Check for password input (using label)
  expect(screen.getByLabelText(/Password/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  
  // Check for submit button (using role)
  expect(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /Sign In/i })).toBeInTheDocument();

  // REMOVED: Link checks - these are likely outside this specific component's scope
});
```

## Expected Result
The test passes, confirming that the essential input fields and the submit button of the login form are rendered upon initial mount.
