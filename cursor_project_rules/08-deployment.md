# 8. Deployment Strategy

This document outlines the planned approach for deploying the RISE platform. Specific details (e.g., hosting provider, CI/CD tools) are TBD and will be updated as decisions are made.

## Environments
*   **Development:** Local developer machines.
*   **Staging (Recommended):** A pre-production environment mirroring production for testing.
*   **Production:** The live environment accessible to users.

## Frontend Deployment
*   **Hosting:** TBD (Options: Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3/CloudFront, Supabase Hosting if suitable).
*   **Build Process:** Standard React build process (`npm run build` or `yarn build`).
*   **CI/CD:** TBD (Options: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Vercel/Netlify integrations).
    *   Automated builds and deployments triggered on pushes/merges to specific branches (e.g., `main` for production, `develop` for staging).

## Backend Deployment (Supabase)
*   **Edge Functions:** Deployed via the Supabase CLI (`supabase functions deploy <function_name>`). CI/CD pipelines should automate this process.
*   **Database Migrations:** Managed using Supabase's built-in migration tools or external tools like `dbmate`. Migrations should be applied automatically via the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Configuration:** Environment variables (API keys, database connection strings, OpenAI keys) will be managed securely using Supabase project settings and environment secrets.

## General Process
1.  Code changes are pushed to Git.
2.  CI/CD pipeline triggers on relevant branch pushes/merges.
3.  Pipeline runs linters, formatters (and tests when implemented).
4.  Frontend is built.
5.  Database migrations are applied (staging/production).
6.  Supabase Edge Functions are deployed (staging/production).
7.  Built frontend is deployed to hosting provider (staging/production).
