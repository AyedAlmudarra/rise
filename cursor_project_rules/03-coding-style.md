# 3. Coding Style and Conventions

## Formatting & Linting
*   **Tools:** ESLint and Prettier will be used for code linting and formatting.
*   **Configuration:** We will adhere strictly to the default ESLint and Prettier configurations provided within the MaterialM React Admin template. No custom rules will be introduced initially unless explicitly agreed upon.
*   **Execution:** Formatting and linting checks should be integrated into the development workflow (e.g., pre-commit hooks, IDE integration) to ensure consistency.

## Naming Conventions
*   Follow standard conventions for TypeScript and React (e.g., `PascalCase` for components and types, `camelCase` for variables and functions).
*   Prioritize descriptive and explicit names over overly short or ambiguous ones.

## General Guidelines
*   Adhere to the existing coding patterns and practices found within the MaterialM template codebase.
*   Write clear, readable, and maintainable code.
