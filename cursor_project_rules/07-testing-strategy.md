# 7. Testing Strategy

This document outlines the approach to testing for the RISE platform.

## Initial Phase (Focus on Quality)
*   **Frameworks Deferred:** Formal testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, Vitest, Cypress, Playwright) will **not** be implemented in the initial development stages.
*   **Priority:** The immediate focus is on writing high-quality, readable, maintainable, and robust code.
*   **Developer Responsibility:** Developers are responsible for manually testing their features thoroughly during development to catch obvious bugs and ensure functionality meets requirements.
*   **Code Reviews:** Peer code reviews are encouraged to identify potential issues, enforce coding standards, and share knowledge.

## Future Phases (Implementation of Formal Testing)
*   **Re-evaluation:** The need for and scope of formal testing will be re-evaluated as the platform matures and grows in complexity.
*   **Potential Test Types:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** To test individual functions, components, or modules in isolation (e.g., utility functions, specific UI components, Edge Function logic). Frameworks like Jest or Vitest with React Testing Library could be used.
    *   **Integration Tests:** To test the interaction between different parts of the system (e.g., frontend component calling a Supabase Edge Function, interaction with the Supabase database).
    *   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** To simulate real user scenarios across the entire application (e.g., user signup flow, investor requesting data room access). Frameworks like Cypress or Playwright could be used.
*   **Test Location:** Tests, when implemented, should reside close to the code they are testing (e.g., `*.test.ts` files alongside components or functions).
*   **CI Integration:** Automated tests should eventually be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to run automatically on code changes.

## Current Expectation
*   While automated tests are deferred, all code should be written with testability in mind (e.g., pure functions, clear separation of concerns) to facilitate easier testing later.
*   Ensure robust error handling and logging are implemented to help diagnose issues.
