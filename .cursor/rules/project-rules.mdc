**Key Principles:**
*   Strictly follow the rules defined in the linked documents.
*   Adhere to the MaterialM template structure and coding style.
*   Prioritize clear communication: **Never make assumptions.** If requirements or context are unclear, always ask for clarification before proceeding.
*   Write clear, understandable, and maintainable code: Favor explicit variable names, add comments for complex logic, and ensure code is easy to modify.
*   Focus on code quality and bug prevention: Manually test changes thoroughly. Write code defensively, considering edge cases and potential errors, even without automated tests initially.
*   Update @implementation-plan.mdc after completing each task.
